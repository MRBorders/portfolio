            <section> My name is Matthew Borders, I am currently enrolled in the coding bootcamp at Georgia Tech and loving it! For a while now i have been looking to change careers from journeyman welder and apprentice elevator technician to a more personaly rewarding life in web-development. In this site i have compiled projects i am working on currently as well as my greatest hits.
                For a majority of my working life i have been utilising my body my body over my mind and i am elated for the change in pace. My biggest goal going forward is to fill this page with my school project to show friends and family my progress as a web developer in training.   </section>
